//CONTROL STATEMENTS IN C++
//1. SEQUENTIAL STATEMENTS //statements executed in sequence
//2. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS //if, if-else, nested if, switch-case, ternary operator
//3. LOOPING STATEMENTS //for, while, do-while, nested loops, break, continue, infinite loop
//4. JUMP STATEMENTS //goto, return, continue, break, exit(), abort(), longjmp(), aetjmp()

/* Note:
- Control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
- Sequential statements are executed in the order they appear.
- Conditional statements allow branching based on conditions.
- Looping statements enable repeated execution of code blocks.
- Jump statements provide ways to alter the normal flow of execution.
